## What are the main components?

### CocoaPods
The CocoaPods gem which includes the command line support and the installer.

### Cocoapods-core
The CocoaPods-Core gem provides support to work with the models of CocoaPods.

### Xcodeproj
Xcodeproj lets you create and modify Xcode projects from Ruby. Script boring management tasks or build Xcode-friendly libraries. Also includes support for Xcode workspaces (.xcworkspace) and configuration files (.xcconfig).

### Cocoapods-downloader
A small library that provides downloaders for various source types (HTTP/SVN/Git/Mercurial).

### CLAide
I was born out of a need for a simple option and command parser, while still providing an API that allows you to quickly create a full featured command-line interface.
